        <h1>How to Make PotStickers</h1>
<p>This recipe starts with a mixture of ground pork, seasonings, green onions, cabbage and mushrooms. The ingredients are all combined to make the filling for the dumplings. Spoon the filling into dumpling wrappers, then the dumplings are folded. The final step is to cook the dumplings by searing the outsides, then adding a little water so that the filling can cook through.</p>
